## Technology 
React DOM “react document object model “  is the main technology that was used for this project, and of course CSS for some styling. 

## Getting Startted 
- First thing was done is importing React from react in our major component App.js.
Once we had imported react, we initialized the component by creating class app,
and then we used the render method
to display the data.
In order for other files to import this component successfully we exported the App component.

- Then created our Head.js, Data.js, Form.js, Hum.js components under component folder. 

- We made an API call to a URL from  open weather map website openweathermap.org . 

## Components 
- Head.js this file contains the title of the application. 
- Data.js this file contains the data that was called from the API. 
- Form.js this file contains the inputs and the button of the first city. 
- Hum.js this file contains the inputs and the button of the second city.
